The [Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project (LORIP)][1] recovered and restored the images taken by the 5 Lunar Orbiter satellites that NASA sent in 1966 and 1967 to plan the moon landings.
The recovery effort is [an impressive story][2].

The digital artifacts that LORIP created are [now housed at the JPL][3].
In their holdings there are [PNG files created from the original, lossless images][4].
Unfortunately there isn't an easy way to browse them.

This project contains the scripts I used to explore the collection myself.
